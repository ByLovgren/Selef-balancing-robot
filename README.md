Code for a self balancing robot

So here is the code for the robot. Not that I have a consoll whehe one can tune the parameters and updat it to the robot. This done, so that one dose not need to upload the code over and over again when tuning the PID parameters.


Not also that i give the gode avay for free, I will not suport the code in any way. Make the best of it your self.
